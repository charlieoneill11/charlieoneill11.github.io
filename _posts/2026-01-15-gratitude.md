But isn't it meaningful to just want these feelings and connections? I feel lucky to have these people in my life.

Here is what I mean when I say meaning. I get overwhelmed by the branching factor of my life; all the sliding-doors moments I can see and all those I can't, the staggering number of alternative universes where I met different people or no one at all. So when I find a moment meaningful (even a goodbye, especially a goodbye) the meaning is this: somehow, despite all those branches, I ended up in the exact universe where I got to know this particular person.

I don't know how many other worlds would have given me this. All of them, or none. I don't know what I'm missing because I took the wrong door somewhere. But in this branch, I got this. And I'm grateful through the sadness.

Sometimes the gratitude doesn't require consumption. The meaning is not in the feeling itself, but in the cosmic accident that I get to be the one who feels it.
