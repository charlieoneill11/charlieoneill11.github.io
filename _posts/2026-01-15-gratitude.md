But isn't it meaningful to just want these feelings and connections? I feel lucky to have these people in my life. The meaning I derive from these moments, including the final goodbyes, is simply this: I get overwhelmed by the branching factor of my life. I think about all the sliding-doors moments I can see, and all those I can't, and the sheer number of alternative universes out there scares and staggers me, and fills me with awe. So when I find a moment meaningful, the meaning I derive is from the gratitude I have for how lucky I am to live in a universe where I got to feel this emotion. I don't know how many other universes would have let me experience it, I don't know if it's all of them or none, I don't know what feelings I'm missing out on because I'm not in the right universe. But that's how I feel.

Sometimes, however, the gratitude doesn't require consumption. The meaning is not in the feeling itself, but in the cosmic accident that I get to be the one who feels it.
