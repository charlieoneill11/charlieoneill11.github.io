        <p>I cofounded <a href="https://parsed.com/">Parsed</a> to build specialised open-source models that outperform the frontier labs. We raised a seed, got acquired by <a href="https://www.baseten.co/blog/parsed-baseten/#models-need-to-touch-grass">Baseten</a> end of 2025, and I now lead their Model Development Team. Briefly a DPhil student in Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/course-listing/computer-science">Oxford</a> under <a href="https://www.jakobfoerster.com/">Jakob Foerster</a>, <a href="https://www.johnmonash.com/">General Sir John Monash Scholar</a> and <a href="https://tuckwell.anu.edu.au/">Tuckwell Scholar</a> at ANU.
